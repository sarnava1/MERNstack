nodemon looks for any changes that we make and automatically restarts the server

just to start the server we can type: node server

to enable nodemon:
1. go to the package.json file and in scripts add start and server
2. then in console type npm run server and it will run with nodemon as we have added the
   start and the server in the scripts in package.json
